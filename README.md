# Commits notation

For my own convenience I normally use the following sintaxis in my commits:

- **[A]** -> When adding new files
- **[C]** -> When cleaning 'old' stuffs
- **[F]** -> When fixing something
- **[M]** -> When merging branchs
- **[N]** -> When adding a new functionallity
- **[U]** -> When updating code (in general: new adds or refactors)
